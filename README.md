In this page I will introduce you to the Kpop Industry and why you should stan SEVENTEEN.




### KPOP GROUPS

Korean popular music, or K-pop, is a popular genre of music originating from South Korea. K-pop songs contain many musical influences, such as hip-hop, electronic dance, jazz, and rock, performed by groups featuring anywhere from four to 21 members. These are groups and artists formed by various entertainment companies creating catchy K-pop music and targeting younger audiences. The music groups are formed from a group of people who are all particularly talented in at least one of the following: singing, rapping, and dancing.






First of all let's get to know SEVENTEEN.

 # **SEVENTEEN**
![‚òÜ ùñèùñöùñìùñèùñöùñìùñìùñéùñä ‚òÜ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102715123/167885560-daf12e15-4bb8-46b1-83cf-7d1f9eb2294f.jpg)
### Seventeen is considered a "self-producing" idol group, with the members actively involved in songwriting and choreographing, as well as other aspects of their music and performances. They perform as one group but are divided into three units‚Äîhip-hop, vocal, and performance‚Äîeach with a different area of specialization.
### There's something special about SEVENTEEN's energy, whether they're performing on stage or just hanging out together for a variety show. You can really see that they love being around each other and they're having fun doing what they do.
- **Fandom Name**

### **Carat** is the official fandom name of Seventeen. The name was picked through fan votes and was announced on Valentine's Day, 2016. Their fans are the carats that help Seventeen shine. In a video with Vanity Fair, Vernon said, "Back to 2015, before our debut, we performed this song called 'Shining Diamonds.

# ***REASONS WHY YOU SHOULD STAN SEVENTEEN***
### 1. 13 Members With Flawless And Synchronized Moves
The ‚ÄùS‚Äù in SEVENTEEN stands for Synchronized ‚Äì there is no denying the fact that they are one of the most synchronized groups ever. If there is this one reason to stan them, it‚Äôs definitely for their performances. Have you watched SEVENTEEN perform? Once they step on the stage, the spotlight is theirs. From the hand movements to foot stomps, they‚Äôre so satisfying to watch! Their performances are jaw-dropping and show-stopping, they also have top-class choreographies, and their stage aura is no joke ‚Äì it‚Äôs a dream to be able to watch them perform live. 
### 2. Self-Producing Artists
SEVENTEEN are known for producing their own music, and yes they‚Äôve earned the ‚Äúself-producing idols‚Äù title. Most (or should we say all‚Ä¶) of the group‚Äôs releases had the participation of the members themselves, notably Woozi. Woozi is a well-known world-class producer as he has been working and being involved in the creative process in creating masterpieces ever since his debut along with the singer-songwriter and producer Bumzu. 
### 3. They Will Give You All The Content You Need

They spoil CARATs so much, and their fans couldn‚Äôt ask for more. Releasing full-group music is the content most Korean pop groups give to their fans, but that isn‚Äôt enough for SEVENTEEN! The group‚Äôs variety show Going Seventeen a.k.a. GoSe definitely is a top-tier idol variety show that gives an emotional rollercoaster ride to fans. The variety series started in 2017 and is free to watch, and it airs weekly up until now. You will definetely enjoy the show and love it until you watch it over and over again.
### 4. Talents and Visuals
Each of the members has this unique feature that make them stand out.
### 5. Their love for Carats

Seventeen wrote a lot of song for their fans such as ‚ÄúHealing,‚Äù ‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù ‚ÄúSmile flower‚Äù and many more. They never failed to mention the fandom everytime they got a chance to do so and even post a letter to their fans. Carats are in awe knowing that the said group have done enough for them to be happy, but it seems like Seventeen is still thinking on how to pay back the love that they are receiving from their fans.
